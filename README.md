**Note:** Make sure you put in your Github username in “GithubUserName” and the repository name you created in “GithubRepoName” sections of the URL.

`$ ng build --prod`

When everithing is commited in `Main` or `Master`

Go to Repo Settings in Github
Scroll down to pages
In `Source`
Select Branch `Main` and `Docs`

**Wait a few minutes** until your site is built and published.

Go to the link provided by Github and hard refresh if it is necessary.

**NOTE** it seems that some times you should create into `Docs` a `404.html` file and copy in there everithing from `index.htm

## Circle CI
To adapt CI to your project you need:

1. Create your `yaml` configuration. This can be just copy from this project, is very basic just run the unit tests and build the app.
2. Log in into Circle CI.
3. Go to your `Projects`.
4. Set Up Project button.
5. It will ask you for your yaml, just upload the example you have in this repo path: `.circleci/config.yml`.
6. Thats it.!!!!
